# ReverseECG

This is the code of paper "[A simple self-supervised ECG representation learning method via manipulated temporalâ€“spatial reverse detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809422006486)".

This is only an example of our method. The parameters are to be adjusted by the users, and the downstream task is also needed to be added by the users.

If you have any problem, please contact me (zhangwenrui@u.nus.edu).
